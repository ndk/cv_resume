### About me
5+ years in backend development using Golang. Extensive experience working with Docker and Kubernetes. Numerous projects from scratch to real-world production based on concepts like microservice architecture, low-code concept, CQRS/ES.

My aspirations also include working on complex distributed systems, highload/low latency services, as well as exploring new ways to tackle a variety of challenges.

### Skills and technologies
- Go(golang), Kafka, gRPC/protobuf, RESTful webservices, Kubernetes, Redis, Docker, Opentracing(Jaeger), Swagger
- Developing distributed systems
- Microservice architecture
- Code design and architecture
- CQRS/Event Sourcing
- Unit-testing, TDD, SOLID, KISS
- English Upper-Intermediate

### Professional Experience

  ##### Personal achievements:
  - Completely reworked the definitions of deployment of backend services which were initially dispersed through the infrastructure
  - Played a decisive role in architectural decisions. Wrote proofs-of-concept, demos, and the first version of the core services
Endorsed Low-Code Concept. During the experimenting with the product team, we figured out that it would be vital to have the ability to change business flows as easily as possible
  - Picked up Camunda (https://camunda.com) as the base of Low-Code Concept implementation. Later we won the Russian Award as a BPM-project of the year (http://bpmaward.ru/summary-2019/)
  - Incorporated and elaborated the CQRS/ES. Further, it became obvious that we got another opportunity to make our backend more reliable and an ability to develop features as pluggable components
  - Introduced Kafka to broker messages and events. As a continuation of developing the event sourcing idea, Kafka became a base for this
  - Built the core services responsible for business flows like those for selling insurance policies, handling car accidents, gathering metrics; as well as communications with the mobile application, the web-client; and many other auxiliary services
